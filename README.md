# Bi-Model-Intent-And-Slot
Implementation of "[A Bi-model based RNN Semantic Frame Parsing Model for Intent Detection and Slot Filling](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.10235)".

What a strange thing is that this article  ***without any detail*** about their experiments. So, lots of module and hyper-parameters need to test! 



## Experiment

Dataset: **ATIS**.

Result with decoder as paper described.

2019-06-12: accuracy of intent detection is  *97.19%*  (about 10 epoch).



**In progress...**
